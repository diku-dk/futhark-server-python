# Python implementation of the Futhark server protocol

This library library provides an implementation of the
[Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org) [server
protocol](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/server-protocol.html).
This can be used to interact with Futhark code in a more decoupled
manner than through an FFI.
